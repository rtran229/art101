			<h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a string of numbers and variables with your partner, similar to the one we made in Lecture.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not a lot of serious problems, but I had a hard time updating because I had my variables named differently.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>It was simple, but I think it looks a bit unclean and it's hard to play around with the words. Either way it was a fairly lax lab because I did part of this in lecture.</p>
