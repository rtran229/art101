			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To pseudocode a potential game design idea for a project, and to get our files ready to go!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not much came up, other than figuring out the game itself! We just settled on one that we were both interested in, which happened to be Blackjack. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>All in all, it went well, and is much easier now that we both know what we're doing. I feel like I'm learning a lot when it comes to code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<p> We put our pseudocode in our Lab 4 Results:
						//START
						//Initialize deck
						//Shuffle deck
						//Deal two cards to the player.
						//Deal two cards to the dealer.
						//Display the player's hand.
						//Display one dealer card (hide the other)
						//WHILE player wants to hit AND player total < 21
						  //  Deal one card to the player.
						  //  Display the updated hand.
						//IF player total > 21
						  //  Display "Player busts – Dealer wins
						  //  END GAME
						//Reveal the dealer's hidden card.
						//WHILE dealer total < 17
						  //  Deal one card to the dealer.
						  //  Display updated dealer hand
						//IF dealer total > 21
						  //  Display "Dealer busts – Player wins"
						//ELSE
						  //  Compare the player's total to the dealer's total.
						  //  IF player total > dealer total
							  //  Display "Player wins"
							//ELSE IF player total < dealer total
							  //  Display "Dealer wins"
							//ELSE
							  //  Display "Push – It's a tie"
						//END GAME
