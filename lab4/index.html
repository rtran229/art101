			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>To pseudocode a potential game design idea for a project, and to get our files ready to go!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Not much came up, other than figuring out the game itself! We just settled on one that we were both interested in, which happened to be Blackjack. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>All in all, it went well, and is much easier now that we both know what we're doing. I feel like I'm learning a lot when it comes to code. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
					<p> We put our pseudocode in our Lab 4 Results:</p>
